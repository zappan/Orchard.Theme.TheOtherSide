The Other Side theme for the Orchard CMS
========================================

A clean and light theme with nice typography, designed primarily for running a blog on [Orchard CMS](http://orchardproject.net/).

## What is Orchard?

Orchard CMS is a nice modular CMS built on top of the Microsoft's MVC web stack, which can also be run on Mono. 

Although it's a new player in the CMS arena, it promises great experience when building websites on top of it. It combines the simplicity and ease of use of WordPress, with the power concepts of Drupal. Its clean architecture won't make developers cry when something needs to be extended or changed.

## About "The Other Side" theme

This is a theme I built while exploring the Orchard CMS, and decided to use it for my blog. It can be seen in action at [The Other Side of Code](http://www.theothersideofcode.com/) blog.

I've decided to open source the theme to make it available for all the people interested in Orchard CMS, whether to use it on their own website, or as a reference to extend it or build their own theme.

## Installation

Install theme from the [Orchard Gallery](http://www.orchardproject.net/gallery/List/Themes/Orchard.Theme.TheOtherSide) by following the official [theme installation guide](http://orchardproject.net/docs/Installing-themes.ashx#Installing_a_Theme_from_the_Gallery_0)

Alternatively, download a theme and install from your local computer by following [this section](http://www.orchardproject.net/docs/Installing-themes.ashx#Installing_a_Theme_from_your_Local_Computer_1) of the theme installation guide.
